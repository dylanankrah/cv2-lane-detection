    - converting original images to HSL
    - isolate white and yellow from HSL 
    - convert to grayscale
    - apply Gaussian Blur for smooth edges
    - apply Canny Edge Detection
    - discard uninteresting lines outside the road
    - Hough transform to find lanes equations
    - separate left & right lanes
    - create smooth guiding lines
